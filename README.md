## Development
### Project structure
```
FastCopy
    FastCopy\               --- Main project
    FastCopyShellExtension\ --- A dll project for registering the new Windows context menu
    SpeedTest\              --- A speed test project for measuring various copying method under Windows
    UnitTest\               --- Unit test for above projects
    FastCopy.sln            --- The solution file for all the projects
```
### Build pre-requisites
- Visual Studio 2019+, with C++20 support & Universal Windows development workload
- Windows App Sdk, with C++ template
- Additional dependencies per project:
  + FastCopy:
    - spdlog
    - boost-algorithm
  + SpeedTest:
    - abseil
    - ftxui
    - cereal

[vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) is the recommended package manager to handle these dependencies. 
You can install them with one command, and do no more.
```
vcpkg install boost-algorithm:x64-windows
vcpkg install spdlog:x64-windows
vcpkg install abseil:x64-windows
vcpkg install ftxui:x64-windows
vcpkg install cereal:x64-windows
``` 
### Known issue
- App crash after the window closed (does not affect users, low priority)

### Recommendation
Please install the [Child Process Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool2022), so that the debugger would break at the copying process (after you launch the settings process). 
That is, you run the program first (so it goes into settings), then copy-paste a file, then the debugger will break automatically. 
Strongly recommended!
